## Inspiration

ASMR is primarily known for its role in relaxation, stress relief, and sleep induction. However, a growing body of research suggests that the unique state induced by ASMR may have measurable effects on cognitive function, including attention, focus, and memory.

## What it does

AuraLuna creates on-demand ASMR, utilizing AI - Claude for creative text generation and Fish Audio for cloned voice synthesis.

## How I built it

AuraLuna was built as a Next.js web application, utilizing a hybrid architecture combining an interactive frontend with serverless backend API routes to manage two different AI providers: Claude (for creativity) and Fish Audio (for static TTS).

## User Experience

Logo: Headphones with sound waves worn by a crescent moon, reclining on a cloud.
Palette: Soothing and serene, soft blues, purples, muted grays.
User Input: The user selects a Mood (e.g., "Ocean," "Sleepy") and clicks "Generate Whisper."
Content Creation:
When the client sends a request with a specific mood (e.g., "Ocean"), the backend sends a prompt to Claude (Anthropic).
Claude is instructed to act as a sleep narrator and create a short soothing script based on the user's chosen mood.
The cloned voice reads the script aloud.

## Challenges I ran into

None of the voices on Fish.Audio were soft and slow enough for my purposes. I finally was able to train the model on one of my favorite ASMR artists, ALB. As such, the audio content generated by AuraLuna's text-to-speech (TTS) services is provided for personal, non-commercial use only. Please see additional information below under "Voice Generation Use Policy".

Additionally, I had difficulty getting only cloned voice to be used, instead of the rotation of stock voices available. This was solved after much wheel spinning by using reference_id, alongside model_id.

## Accomplishments that I am proud of

I was a solo team who only started the CalHacks project work on Saturday and thus relied on LLMs for aspects of my project (Gemini, OpenAi). I loved the logo I was able to design through a mix of Gemini, OpenAi, and Canva and was able to achieve a soothing and simple color palette through the use of Tailwind.

#Voice Generation Use Policy
